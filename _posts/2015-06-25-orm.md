##My ORM

####What's an ORM?
> Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a technique (a.k.a. design pattern) of accessing a relational database from an object-oriented language.

Converting data stored in my database to a language I can work with is done with `CONNECTION.results_as_hash = true`. This allows me to take table information and put it into a hash. I could make this work, but it would be so much easier to convert that hash into an object. 

Well, I can do that by giving my initialize a hash for a parameter. Now when I get info from the database and call a .new on a Class with a hash (storing table data) as an argument, I get an object I can work with.


####How does your ORM help you get all of a particular table's rows from the database?

```ruby
CONNECTION.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
```

To get a particular table's rows from the database, running the above command will return the rows as an Array of Hashes. The "*" serves as telling the database to select all of the columns in a row.

```ruby
=> [{"id"=>4, "name"=>"Gemma Rae", 0=>4, 1=>"Gemma Rae"},
 {"id"=>6, "name"=>"John Marston", 0=>6, 1=>"John Marston"},
 {"id"=>7, "name"=>"Amy Stephen", 0=>7, 1=>"Amy Stephen"},
 {"id"=>8, "name"=>"Jason Zoz", 0=>8, 1=>"Jason Zoz"},
 {"id"=>9, "name"=>"Walter White", 0=>9, 1=>"Walter White"}]
```


####How does your ORM represent rows from a table, given that Ruby doesn't have a Table data structure?

By initializing a new object with the class related to the table in use (and remove the object from the array)

```ruby
User.new(CONNECTION.execute("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = 6").first)
```

I can make the program return an User object.

```ruby
 # => #<User:0x007f876cbc4e68 @id=6, @name="John Marston">
```

Notice I've matched my @attributes with the column names of the table? This makes modifying a table with a Ruby object a whole lot simpler. :)


####How does your ORM convert rows from a table into the Ruby data structure (which you identified in the previous question)?

* Step 1: make a query
* Step 2: return an array of hashes
* Step 3: remove hash from array
* Step 4: use initialize to make an object with the returned hash as an argument
* Step 5: you've converted a row from a table into the Ruby data structure
